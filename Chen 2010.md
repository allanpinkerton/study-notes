## Summary
TLS/SSL alone is *not enough to ensure users' privacy*. HTTPS web traffic could leak a significant amount of information about the user. Researchers were able to obtain information such as: the user's income, family composition, search queries typed into Google, investment portfolio, asset allocation, and more by observing *encrypted network data* and analyzing the state transitions of the web application.

Furthermore, there is not *general solution* to mitigate side channel attacks: each application needs to be designed with security in mind and implement protections specific to the logic of the application.

## General Notes
Partial data on an app's internal data flows exposed on the network could reveal application states and state transitions

Packet sizes and timings could reveal information on the user's actions. For example, selecting different illnesses from a drop down might cause the server to reply with different sized data based on the illness.

Images and web pages have different sizes, so attackers can fingerprint pages based on their size and determine what page the user visited even over HTTPS.

Modern web applications have highly interactive GUI components: even a single mouse click or keystroke could trigger web traffic, which could leave the app's state information. An example is auto-suggestion widgets used by search engines such as Google that populates a suggestions list based on every keystroke of the user.

Modern apps are usually stateful. This means the attacker can eliminate possibilities based on impossible to reach states. For example, if $state_x$ is only reachable from $state_a$, and $state_b$, then the attacker can eliminate inputs that leads the user to $state_c$, or any other state that is not a or b.

The larger the variation in packet sizes, the more information it reveals to the attacker.

Need to be aware of assets loaded from external sites, as we have no control over whether these assets expose information about the user.

## Sample Attacks
### Online Health App 
Site uses HTTPS exclusively.

User enters their medical information: conditions, medications, procedures, etc. Eavesdropper can infer the medications the user takes, the procedures she has and the type of doctors she is looking for.

On the conditions tab, there is an input box that updates suggestions based on every keystroke the user inputs. The suggestion list narrows down as the user types more letters. Based on the size of the responses returned from the server, the attacker was able to determine which condition the user typed.

Another way to select condition was from to select from an alphabetical list. The user can pick the first letter of the condition, which narrows down the list. Again, based on the size of the response the attacker was able to determine which letter the user selected. Then, due to each condition returning differently sized responses, the attacker could easily guess which condition the user picked. This method made guessing the condition 1068 times easier for the attacker to guess the correct condition.

The response for "Find a doctor" feature had similar flaws.

### Online Tax App

Tax app is *stateful*. The app the user simple questions about their income situation and tailors future questions based on user's earlier answers. The tax forms that the user needs to fill also depends on answers to these questions.

The attacker can guess the number of children in the family by seeing how many times the user fills out the "Add a dependent" page or guess whether the spouse has income based on whether the corresponding W-2 form was filled.

The Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) of the user is hard to guess by the size of the traffic - it takes info from various different forms which gives it high entropy, making it a hard target for side channel attacks. However, the attacker could deduce the AGI based on other forms the user fills out, since the user's eligibilities for some tax credits depend on their AGI, and forms/screens displayed also vary based on AGI. The attacker could monitor the web traffic/state to deduce a range for the AGI by monitoring these states.

An example of this deduction is using Student Loan Interest deductions. The user is only eligible for this deduction if their AGI is lower that \$145,000. If they are not eligible, the app skips the step that asks for their interest. This means, if the user was eligible for the interest rate deductions, their flow of state transitions would be one node longer, which provides attackers a way to determine if the user's AGI was higher or lower than \$145,000.

Combining rules for tax laws and the user's transition flows, the attacker could deduce a more accurate AGI range as well as additional information such as whether the user pay mortgages, has large medical bills, etc.

### OnlineInvest.com

In this case, private information is leaked via graphical visualization of the data.

The choices of mutual funds have low entropy since there are not that many to choose from. This makes it possible to determine which mutual fund the user is viewing based on the size of the <img> tags loaded on the page. In fact, the sizes of all the images loaded are distinctively identifiable for each mutual fund.

The dashboard also displays a pie chart of the user's allocations in different mutual funds. This pie chart is updated daily when the markets close. The attacker was able to determine the specific allocation of the user by studying the traffic that updates this pie chart and comparing it to the price changes of all mutual funds listed in the US. *Experimental attacks performed by the researchers showed that they were able to infer the specific allocation of the user by analyzing price changes over 4 days* 

### Google, Yahoo, Bing Search

Auto suggest features leak information, similar to the Online Health App scenario. While the set of possible suggestions in a Google query is much larger than that in the Health App, the set quickly narrows down the more characters the user types. For a query of length $l$, the attacker only needed to guess $27*l$ times to figure out the user's query.


## Challenges When Mitigating Side Channel Attacks
The researchers show that it is hard to find a "universal" solution to mitigate against side channel threats. The developers need to implement app-specify logic based on how their app interacts with the network.

The analysis below only looks at *application agnostic* mitigation methods.

### Mitigations for Online Health Leaks
Adding noise packets is hard to implement for web application in an application agnostic manner, since fake packets unrelated to the application state can be easily identified by running the application twice and comparing the traffic.

Padding is the most straight forward application-agnostic strategy to apply in this situation. The researchers tried to strategies to round the size of packets (so all packets are a multiple of $n$ bytes) and randomly padding packets. The results for both strategies are very similar.

The researcher tried different rounding sizes for the packets, and showed that packet sizes up till 512 bytes do not yield satisfactory results - the packets still leak enough information for the attacker to deduce which condition the user selected in most cases. This was true until the packets are rounded to the nearest 512 byte, which causes a large overhead (a third of the network traffic was padding).

### Mitigations for Online Tax Leaks

Padding was ineffective in this case. The researchers showed that even when padding to 2048 bytes, the state transitions still give away 7 distinct income ranges, while the padding would already takes up 38.1% of the application's network traffic.

The researchers estimated that a network overhead of 21074% was necessary to hide all state informations.

### Mitigations for Search Engine Leaks

Mitigations in the search engine case was made especially hard due to search engines needing to handle high volumes of traffic, which amplifies the costs of applying application-agnostic solutions unsustainably high.

Adding compression (such as gzip) would also complicate the situation, as decisions also need to be made on when to pad the content (pad before or after compression) affects the effectiveness of the padding scheme.

### Mitigations for Online Invest Leaks

Hiding information for the pie chart (asset allocation data) only needs the content to be padded to 32 bytes.

Certain data, such as price charts, are fetched from external websites, which Online Invest has no control over.
