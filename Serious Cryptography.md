# Serious Cryptography

## Chapter 1 Encryption
Worth reading over.

Good introduction to crypto and history of crypto

Key Points:
    - One Time Pad & Perfect (Informational) Security
    - Definition for security and attack models (chosen plaintext, cyphertext only, etc.)
    - Side channel attacks and invasive attacks
    - Encryption goals (IND-CPA)

## Chapter 2 Randomness

Read: Pages 22-29

Key Points:
    - Entropy
    - RNG vs PRNG
    - Backward/Forward security
    - Cryptographic vs non-cryptographic PRNG

## Chapter 3 Cryptographic Security

Key Points:
    - Computational Security
    - Costs of attack
    - Evaluating security levels
    - Provable security vs Heuristic Security
    - Key Derivation functions
    - Key wrapping
